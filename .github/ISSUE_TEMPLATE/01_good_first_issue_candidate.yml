        > ### 📋 Good First Issue (GFI) Guidelines
        > Good First Issues work best when they have a narrow scope, clear instructions, and example solutions when possible.
        >        
        > Examples of work that fits well as a Good First Issue:
        >
        > - **Mechanical website changes that don't require deep architectural knowledge:**
        >   - Updating deprecated HTML tags or attributes
        >   - Replacing old CSS classes with new ones
        >   - Updating version numbers in configuration files
        >
        > - **Simple bug fixes with clear reproduction steps and expected behavior:**
        >   - Fixing a broken link or image
        >   - Correcting layout issues with clear CSS adjustments
        >   - Accessibility fixes (e.g., adding alt text) when explicitly instructed
        >
        > - **Documentation improvements** that are instruction-driven:
        >   - Fixing known typos or grammar issues
        >   - Updating README sections when new wording is provided
        >   - Making explicitly requested changes to comments or inline docs
        >
        > **Issues that are usually better suited for more experienced contributors:**
        >
        > - Writing new documentation or content without clear guidance
        > - Changes that require deciding *what* to do or *how* something should behave
        > - Work involving CSS, styling, or UX decisions without explicit instructions
        > - Bug fixes that require investigation to understand root cause
        > - Work spanning multiple subsystems or frameworks
        > - Tasks requiring domain, protocol, or architectural knowledge
        >

        **💡 Example of a helpful Problem Description for GFI:**

        ### The Problem
        The Heroes page has a broken link to the Hacktoberfest initiative. When users click 
        on "check out our current Hacktoberfest initiative", they should be taken to the 
        Hacktoberfest page, but the link is not working correctly. 

        Where to Find It
        - **File**:  `content/heroes/index.md`
        - **Line**: 10
        - **Link text**: "check out our current Hacktoberfest initiative"
        - **Current broken URL**: `/hacktoberfest` (missing the correct path)
        - **View the file**: [content/heroes/index.md](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-website/blob/main/content/heroes/index.md#L10)

        Why This Matters
        New contributors visiting the Heroes page can't navigate to the Hacktoberfest initiative,
        which is one of our main ways to welcome first-time contributors.

        **💡 Example of a helpful Proposed Solution for GFI:**

        What Needs to Change
        Update the broken link in the Heroes page to point to the correct Hacktoberfest page.

        Steps to Fix
        1. Navigate to [`content/heroes/index.md`](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-website/blob/main/content/heroes/index.md)
        2. Find line 10 and locate the broken link
        3. Replace the current text:
           ```markdown
           [Hacktoberfest initiative](hacktoberfestt)
           ```
           with the correct link:
           ```markdown
           [Hacktoberfest initiative](/hacktoberfest)
           ```
        4. Save the file

        **💡 Example of helpful Implementation Steps for GFI:**

        Step-by-Step Solution
        1. Open the file `content/heroes/index.md`
        2. Find line 10, which currently says:
        ```markdown
        If you want to contribute to Hiero, please check out our current [Hacktoberfest initiative](hacktoberfestt) that provides a lot of good first issues to get started with.
        ```
        3. Verify the correct link path by checking that the Hacktoberfest content exists at `content/hacktoberfest/`
        4. Confirm the link is correct (it should already be `/hacktoberfest`)
        5. Save the file

        **Note**:  In this example, we'd discover the link might already be correct, so the issue would need investigation first!
