        ## **Thanks for contributing!** 🚀

        We truly appreciate your interest in tackling an **Advanced issue**.

        This template is designed for work that requires **deep familiarity with the Hiero Website**
        and confidence making changes that may span multiple components or affect core behavior.

        The goal is to create issues for contributors who:
        - have strong familiarity with the Hiero Website internals
        - are comfortable reasoning about trade-offs and design decisions
        - can work independently with minimal guidance

      description: Who is this issue intended for?
      value: |
        This issue is intended for contributors who are already very familiar with the
        [Hiero Website](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-website) codebase and its architectural patterns.

        You should feel comfortable with:
        - Netlify previews and tests
        - Hugo content, layouts, templates, and shortcodes
        - The full Hiero website structure and build process
        - Reviewing changes holistically, not file-by-file
        - Anticipating downstream and maintenance impact
        - Communicating design decisions clearly in PRs

        New developers should start with
        **Good First Issues** or **Beginner Issues** first.

        > [!WARNING]
        > ### 🧭 What we consider an *Advanced Issue*
        >
        > This issue typically:
        >
        > - Requires **deep understanding of existing website design and behavior**
        > - May touch **core templates**, shared utilities, or cross-cutting concerns
        > - May involve **non-trivial refactors**, design changes, or behavior extensions
        > - Has **medium to high risk** if implemented incorrectly
        > - Requires careful consideration of **backwards compatibility and accessibility**
        > - May require updating **tests, examples, and documentation together**
        >
        > **What this issue is NOT:**
        > - A simple bug fix
        > - A narrowly scoped refactor
        > - A task solvable by following existing patterns alone
        >

        You may assume the reader:
        - understands the overall website architecture
        - can navigate and reason about multiple components
        - is comfortable reading and modifying core logic

        Clearly explain:
        - what the current behavior is
        - why it is insufficient or incorrect
        - which components or layers are involved
        - any relevant historical or design context

        **🐞 Example of a helpful Problem Description:**

        Current Behavior
        The search functionality on the Hiero website currently uses client-side JavaScript to search through page content. 
        This works well for small sites, but our website has grown to 200+ pages, causing: 
        - Search indexing to take 3-5 seconds on initial page load
        - High memory usage on mobile devices (often causing crashes on older phones)
        - Poor search relevance for technical terms (no stemming or fuzzy matching)

        Why This Matters
        User analytics show that 40% of visitors use the search feature, and bounce rate increases by 25% 
        when search takes longer than 2 seconds to initialize.

        Components Involved
        - `/layouts/partials/search.html` - Main search UI component
        - `/static/js/search.js` - Client-side search logic
        - `/layouts/_default/baseof.html` - Where search scripts are loaded
        - Content files across `/content/` directory (all indexed)

        Historical Context
        The current implementation was added in PR #42 when the site had only 30 pages.

        Describe the intended direction or design.

        This should include:
        - the high-level approach
        - any new abstractions or changes to existing ones
        - constraints (e.g. backwards compatibility, performance, accessibility)
        - known alternatives and why they were rejected (if applicable)

        A full design document is not required, but reasoning and intent should be clear.

        **💡 Example of a helpful Proposed Solution:**

        Approach:
        Migrate from client-side search to a pre-built search index using Hugo's built-in search capabilities 
        with Fuse.js or Pagefind. 

        Key Changes:
        1. **Build-time indexing**: Generate a JSON search index during Hugo build
        2. **Lazy loading**: Only load search scripts when the user opens the search UI
        3. **Improved relevance**: Use Fuse.js fuzzy search with weighted fields (title > headings > body)

        Constraints:
        - **Must maintain current search UI/UX** - users are familiar with the existing interface
        - **Backwards compatible URLs** - search query parameters should continue to work
        - **Accessibility** - maintain ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
        - **Performance target**: Search index should load in < 500ms on 3G connection

        Alternatives Considered:
        - **Algolia/External Service**: Rejected due to cost and privacy concerns
        - **Full Server-Side Search**: Rejected because we're a static site (no backend)
        - **Keep Current Approach**: Would require significant optimization with diminishing returns

        **🧠 Example of helpful Implementation Notes:**

        Modules and Components
        
        Files to Modify
        - `/layouts/partials/search.html` - Update to load search index
        - `/static/js/search.js` - Replace with Fuse.js implementation
        - `/layouts/index.json` - Create new search index template
        - `/config.toml` - Add output format for JSON index

        Files to Add
        - `/static/js/fuse.min.js` - Fuse.js library (version 6.6.2)
        - `/layouts/_default/search-index.json` - Template for search entries

        Suggested Refactoring Strategy
        
        1. **Phase 1**: Create JSON index without breaking existing search
           - Add new `index.json` output format
           - Generate search index at build time
           - Test index generation locally
        
        2. **Phase 2**:  Implement lazy loading
           - Wrap search script loading in intersection observer
           - Add loading state to search UI
           - Test on slow connections
        
        3. **Phase 3**: Replace search logic
           - Swap out old search.js with Fuse.js implementation
           - Maintain existing search API/interface
           - Run A/B comparison of search results quality

        Migration Concerns:
        - Existing bookmarks with search queries must continue to work
        - Search index should be cached by CDN (set appropriate headers)
        - Consider index size - may need to exclude certain content types

        Testing Strategy:
        - Unit tests for search index generation
        - E2E tests for search UI interaction (Playwright)
        - Performance tests:  measure index load time and search speed
        - Accessibility audit with screen reader
        - Test on mobile devices (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)

        Performance Considerations:
        - Search index size should be < 500KB gzipped
        - Consider splitting index by section if it grows too large
        - Use CDN caching headers (1 week cache, revalidate on deploy)

        Security Considerations:
        - Ensure search index doesn't include draft/private content
        - Validate search queries to prevent XSS (though Fuse.js handles this)
