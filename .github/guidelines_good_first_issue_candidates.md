# Good First Issue — Candidate Guidelines (Hiero Website)

This document defines the purpose and usage of the **`good first issue: candidate`** label for the **Hiero website repository**.

It intentionally **does not redefine what a Good First Issue is**.  
Instead, it exists to **gate and protect** the standards defined in:

👉 **[Good First Issue Guidelines](./guidelines_good_first_issues.md)**

## Purpose

The **`good first issue: candidate`** label represents a **temporary holding state**.

It indicates that an issue:
- Might qualify as a Good First Issue
- Appears small and low risk
- But **does not yet meet all requirements** defined in the  
  **Good First Issue Guidelines**

The candidate label exists so maintainers can **refine an issue before exposing it** as a Good First Issue.

> The candidate label is **not** a weaker GFI.  
> It is a **quality-control step**.

---

## Why the Candidate Label Exists

Applying the **Good First Issue** label signals that an issue is:

- Fully specified
- Mechanical
- Low risk
- Ready for self-assignment by first-time contributors

If that signal is wrong, contributor trust is weakened.

The **candidate** label exists to:

- 🚫 Prevent premature Good First Issue labeling
- 🧭 Enforce adherence to the Good First Issue Guidelines
- 🛠 Give maintainers time to add missing details
- 📋 Provide a clear promotion path to GFI

---

## When to Use `good first issue: candidate`

Apply the **candidate** label when:

- The issue appears to fit the **[Good First Issue Guidelines](./guidelines_good_first_issues.md)**
- But one or more required elements are missing or unclear

Typical reasons include:
- Missing exact file paths
- Missing explicit implementation steps
- Missing acceptance criteria
- Uncertainty about whether the issue is truly mechanical

If you are unsure whether an issue fully meets the GFI bar, **use the candidate label**.

---

## What the Candidate Label Is NOT

The candidate label must **not** be used for issues that clearly violate the  
**Good First Issue Guidelines**.

Do **not** use the candidate label if the issue:

- Requires deciding *what* to change
- Requires deciding *how* content should read or look
- Involves Hugo layouts, themes, or templates
- Involves CSS, styling, or UX
- Is exploratory, investigative, or blocked
- Would never qualify as a Good First Issue even after refinement

> If an issue will **never** meet the **[Good First Issue Guidelines](./guidelines_good_first_issues.md)**,  
> do **not** label it as a candidate.

---

## Promoting a Candidate to Good First Issue

A candidate may be promoted **only after it fully satisfies** the  
**Good First Issue Guidelines — Hiero Website**.

Promotion requires that **all GFI requirements are met**, including:
- Fully specified solution
- Exact files, text, or values
- Objective acceptance criteria
- No interpretation or judgment required

---

## Promotion Process

1. Review the issue against the **Good First Issue Guidelines**
2. Add any missing instructions, details, or acceptance criteria
3. Confirm the issue clearly meets all GFI requirements
4. Remove the `good first issue: candidate` label
5. Apply the **Good First Issue** label

---

## Maintainer Checklist

Use the **candidate** label if:

- The issue seems like it *could* be a Good First Issue
- But you are not yet comfortable advertising it as one

When in doubt, **use the candidate label first**.

---

## Final Rule

> The **Good First Issue Guidelines** define the standard.  
> The **candidate label** exists to protect it.
