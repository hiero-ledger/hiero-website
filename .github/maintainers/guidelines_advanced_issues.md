# Advanced Issue Guidelines — Hiero Website

Advanced Issues represent the **highest tier of contribution** for the Hiero website.

They’re designed for contributors who are comfortable working across the full repository, understand Hugo’s structure and behavior, and are ready to take ownership of **high-impact changes from design through delivery**.

This guide builds on:

- **[Good First Issue Guidelines](./guidelines_good_first_issues.md)**
- **[Beginner Issue Guidelines](./guidelines_beginner_issues.md)**
- **[Intermediate Issue Guidelines](./guidelines_intermediate_issues.md)**

and exists to support consistent, clear use of the **Advanced Issue** label.

## How to Use This Document

This guide supports maintainers and issue creators who use the **Advanced Issue** label.

It offers shared language and examples to help:

**Issue creators:**
- Propose well-scoped, high-impact Advanced Issues  
- Describe problems clearly, even when solutions are open-ended  
- Decide when a task is better suited for a different issue category  

**Maintainers:**
- Apply the Advanced label consistently  
- Set clear expectations for scope and responsibility  

This isn’t a rulebook, and it’s not meant to limit what kinds of contributions are welcome.

All contributions — from small fixes to major improvements — are valuable to the Hiero project.  
This guide simply highlights the kinds of tasks that benefit from deeper ownership and broader system-level thinking.

---

## Purpose

Advanced Issues are designed to:

- Enable high-impact, high-responsibility contributions  
- Improve long-term usability, clarity, and maintainability  
- Support thoughtful evolution of site structure and patterns  
- Prepare contributors for ongoing ownership or stewardship  

These issues often affect:

- Multiple sections of the site  
- Site-wide behavior or structure  
- Public-facing UX or navigation  
- Long-term content strategy or governance materials  

Because of their scope, they benefit from careful review, discussion, and iteration.

## How Advanced Issues Differ from Intermediate Issues

Advanced Issues introduce more system-level responsibility than Intermediate Issues.

They often:

- Involve architectural or design decisions  
- Require evaluating trade-offs  
- Affect multiple areas of the site  
- Introduce or refine conventions and patterns  
- Have long-term impact  

**Helpful way to think about it:**

- If the task involves choosing *how* to solve a well-scoped problem → *Intermediate Issue*  
- If the task involves shaping or evolving the system itself → *Advanced Issue*  

---

## Assumptions

Advanced Issues are designed for contributors who are comfortable working independently and holistically.

They aim to:

- Build on strong familiarity with the repository and workflow  
- Encourage system-level thinking  
- Support thoughtful, well-communicated design decisions  
- Keep changes intentional, reviewable, and maintainable  

They don’t require marketing authority or unilateral decision-making — collaboration and alignment are still key.

---

## What We Consider Advanced Issues

Advanced Issues are typically:

- Clearly motivated but not fully scripted  
- Multi-file or site-wide in scope  
- Design- and decision-heavy  
- High impact, with medium to high risk  
- Expected to involve discussion and iteration  

They often start with a **problem statement**, not a complete solution.

---

### 1. Information Architecture & Navigation

These involve **how users find and understand content**.

#### Good fits
- Redesigning navigation or menus  
- Restructuring documentation hierarchies  
- Introducing new content groupings or sections  
- Improving discoverability across the site  

#### Less ideal
- Small ordering tweaks  
- Mechanical link changes  

---

### 2. Hugo Templates, Layouts & Shortcodes

These involve **site behavior and rendering**.

#### Good fits
- Creating or modifying Hugo layouts or partials  
- Introducing new shortcodes  
- Refactoring templates for maintainability  
- Improving performance or flexibility of layouts  

#### Less ideal
- Minor frontmatter-only changes  
- Content-only updates without layout impact  

---

### 3. Site-Wide Content & Structural Refactors

These involve **broad consistency and maintainability work**.

#### Good fits
- Large-scale documentation reorganizations  
- Migrating content to new structures  
- Removing or consolidating deprecated sections  
- Enforcing new conventions across the site  

#### Less ideal
- Single-page edits  
- Refactors without a clear migration plan  

---

### 4. UX, Accessibility & Visual Changes

These involve **how the site looks and feels**.

#### Good fits
- Accessibility improvements (ARIA, contrast, semantics)  
- Visual or layout redesigns  
- Responsive behavior improvements  
- Interaction or usability enhancements  

#### Less ideal
- Minor cosmetic tweaks  
- One-off styling fixes  

---

### 5. Strategic Editorial & Governance Content

These involve **high-importance content**.

#### Good fits
- Governance, roadmap, or policy documentation  
- Major announcements or structured blog series  
- Defining editorial standards or conventions  
- Content requiring cross-team alignment  

#### Less ideal
- Casual blog posts  
- Minor documentation updates  

---

## What’s Typically Not an Advanced Issue

Some kinds of work are usually better suited for other issue categories, such as:

- Purely mechanical tasks  
- Small, localized changes  
- Fully scripted work  
- Low-risk formatting or content fixes  
- Tasks that don’t involve design or system-level thinking  

---

## Maintainer Guidance

### An Advanced Issue is usually a good fit when:

- It requires architectural or design decisions  
- It has multiple valid solution paths  
- It affects multiple parts of the site  
- It has long-term maintenance implications  
- It benefits from experienced review and iteration  

### A different issue category may be better when:

- The task is primarily mechanical  
- The scope is small and low risk  
- It can be completed without system-level reasoning  
- It would overwhelm or block contributors unnecessarily  

---

## Final Note

Advanced Issues are about **designing and evolving the system**,  
not about learning the workflow.

They help contributors make meaningful, lasting improvements — with care, collaboration, and clarity.
