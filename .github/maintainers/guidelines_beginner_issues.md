# Beginner Issue Guidelines — Hiero Website

Beginner Issues represent the **next step after Good First Issues**.

They’re designed for contributors who feel comfortable with the basics and are ready to take on slightly more open-ended tasks involving light investigation, content improvements, and small structural changes in a Hugo-based website.

This guide builds on the  
**[Good First Issue Guidelines](./guidelines_good_first_issues.md)**  
and exists to support consistent, clear use of the **Beginner Issue** label.

## How to Use This Document

This guide supports maintainers and issue creators who use the **Beginner Issue** label.

It provides shared language and examples to help:

**Issue creators:**
- Feel confident proposing a Beginner Issue  
- Identify tasks that build naturally on Good First Issues  
- Decide when a different issue category might be a better fit  

**Maintainers:**
- Apply the Beginner label consistently  
- Keep issue difficulty levels clear and helpful  

This is not a rulebook, and it’s not meant to limit what kinds of contributions are welcome.

All contributions — big or small, simple or complex — are valuable to the Hiero project.  
This guide simply helps highlight tasks that are well-suited for the next stage of contributor growth.

---

## Purpose

Beginner Issues are designed to:

- Build confidence beyond purely mechanical tasks  
- Encourage light investigation and reasoning  
- Help contributors feel comfortable navigating the repository  
- Prepare contributors for more complex website and Hugo work  

They allow contributors to make **small, safe decisions** while keeping the work low risk and easy to review.

## How Beginner Issues Differ from Good First Issues

Beginner Issues introduce a bit more flexibility than Good First Issues.

They often:

- Involve reading existing content for context  
- Allow for small decisions or interpretation  
- Provide clear intent, even if the exact steps aren’t fully scripted  

**Helpful way to think about it:**

- If the task is fully scripted and purely mechanical → *Good First Issue*  
- If the task involves light investigation and small decisions → *Beginner Issue*  

---

## Assumptions

Beginner Issues are designed for contributors who are getting more comfortable with the project.

They aim to:

- Build on basic familiarity with the repository  
- Encourage exploration of existing content and structure  
- Support thoughtful, low-risk improvements  
- Keep the work approachable and review-friendly  

They don’t require deep framework expertise, advanced frontend work, or design experience — just curiosity and a willingness to learn.

## What We Consider Beginner Issues

Beginner Issues are typically:

- Well-scoped and focused  
- Low to moderate risk  
- Open to questions and discussion  
- Reviewable in a single pull request  

They have **clear intent**, even if the exact implementation leaves room for small decisions.

---

### 1. Content Improvements

These involve **small content changes** that benefit from research and context.

#### Good fits
- Improving clarity or consistency of existing text  
- Updating outdated wording when the new intent is stated  
- Expanding an existing section with a clear goal  
- Consolidating or removing redundant content after review  

#### Less ideal
- Writing entirely new pages  
- Large-scale content rewrites  
- Defining new messaging, tone, or narrative direction  

---

### 2. Hugo Frontmatter & Page Structure

These involve **working with existing page metadata**.

#### Good fits
- Adding missing frontmatter fields based on existing patterns  
- Normalizing frontmatter values across related pages  
- Cleaning up inconsistent frontmatter usage in a directory  
- Adjusting page visibility or ordering with a stated goal  

#### Less ideal
- Designing new frontmatter schemas  
- Changing how Hugo interprets frontmatter  
- Editing layouts, templates, or shortcodes  

---

### 3. Markdown & Documentation Structure

These involve **organizational improvements**.

#### Good fits
- Reorganizing sections to improve clarity  
- Splitting long documents into smaller sections  
- Combining short, redundant sections  
- Improving headings and section hierarchy  

#### Less ideal
- Large documentation restructures  
- Defining new documentation workflows  
- Creating new documentation systems or conventions  

---

### 4. File & Asset Organization

These involve **light cleanup and consistency work**.

#### Good fits
- Identifying and removing unused assets with verification  
- Renaming files for consistency and updating references  
- Consolidating duplicate or redundant assets  
- Improving directory organization with a clear rationale  

#### Less ideal
- Visual or branding changes  
- Image optimization or format conversion  
- Large-scale asset refactors  

---

### 5. Links & References

These involve **judgment-based link maintenance**.

#### Good fits
- Identifying and fixing broken links  
- Updating outdated references based on current project state  
- Normalizing references across related pages  
- Improving internal linking for discoverability  

#### Less ideal
- Site-wide link audits without prior agreement  
- Adding new external references without context  
- SEO-focused or marketing-driven changes  

---

## What’s Typically Not a Beginner Issue

Some kinds of work are usually better suited for more advanced issue categories, such as:

- Hugo themes, layouts, or template changes  
- CSS or styling work  
- UX or visual design changes  
- Navigation or information architecture redesigns  
- Accessibility initiatives  
- Site-wide refactors or audits  
- Strategic or roadmap-driven content changes  

---

## Maintainer Guidance

### A Beginner Issue is usually a good fit when:

- It builds naturally on Good First Issues  
- It involves light investigation or interpretation  
- The intent is clear, even if the steps aren’t fully scripted  
- The scope is focused and low risk  

### A different issue category may be better when:

- The task is purely mechanical (Good First Issue)  
- It requires significant design or UX decisions  
- It spans many unrelated parts of the site  
- It involves architectural or long-term planning work  

---

## Final Note

Beginner Issues are about **growing confidence and capability** —  
not about designing systems or making large structural changes.

They help contributors take the next step while still feeling supported, focused, and successful.
