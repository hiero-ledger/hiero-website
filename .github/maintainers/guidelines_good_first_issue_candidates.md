# Good First Issue — Candidate  

This label helps us shape issues into great entry points for new contributors.

Some issues are *almost* ready to be a “Good First Issue” — they just need a bit more clarity, context, or detail first.  
That’s where the **Good First Issue — Candidate** label comes in.

For the definition of a fully ready Good First Issue, see:  
👉 **[Good First Issue Guidelines](./guidelines_good_first_issues.md)**

## What “Candidate” Means

A **Good First Issue — Candidate** is an issue that:

- ✅ Looks like it could be a good starting point for new contributors  
- ✅ Appears small, contained, and low-risk  
- ✅ There is some doubt if it is a GFI or lacks documentation

Think of it as:

> “Almost there — just needs a bit of checking or polish.”

The goal is to make sure that when an issue is labeled **Good First Issue**, contributors can confidently pick it up and succeed.

## Why This Label Exists

We want Good First Issues to feel:

- ✅ Approachable  
- ✅ Well-scoped  
- ✅ Clear  
- ✅ Low-friction  

The **Candidate** label gives maintainers time to:

- ✅ Add missing context and help  
- ✅ Confirm it is truly beginner-friendly  

This is important because Github automatically advertises all issues labelled `Good First Issue`. In this way, all our `Good First Issue` are ready for anybody to come, get assigned and succeed.

## When to Use the Candidate Label

Use **Good First Issue — Candidate** when:

- ✅  An issue *seems* like a good fit for new contributors  
- ✅  But something is still unclear or incomplete  

Common examples:

- File paths or locations aren’t specified yet  
- The exact change isn’t fully described  
- Acceptance criteria could be clearer  
- You want to double-check that the task is truly a GFI  

If you’re unsure whether an issue is ready to be advertised as a Good First Issue, the **Candidate** label is a great middle step.

## What the Candidate Label Is (and Isn’t)

### It is:

- A staging area for promising beginner-friendly issues  
- A signal that some refinement may still be needed  
- A way to improve clarity and consistency  

### It isn’t:

- A restriction on who can view or discuss the issue  
- A statement about contributor ability  
- A permanent category  

Some issues will naturally evolve into Good First Issues.  
Others may turn out to be better suited for more experienced contributors — and that's okay too, helping to build confidence and momentum.

## Promoting an Issue to “Good First Issue”

An issue can be promoted once it:

- Has clear, concrete instructions  
- Describes *what* to change and *where*  
- Includes objective acceptance criteria  

### Simple promotion flow:

1. Review the issue against the GFI guidelines  
2. Add or refine instructions as needed  
3. Confirm the scope is beginner-friendly  
4. Replace **Candidate** with **Good First Issue**

---

## For Issue Creators

If an issue feels like:

> “This could be a great first contribution, but needs a little more clarity.”

Use the **Good First Issue — Candidate** label.

# For Maintainers

If a good first issue candidate is truly a `Good First Issue` and is well-documented

Swap the **Good First Issue — Candidate** label for **Good First Issue** label.

If it is more advanced:
- Close the `Good First Issue Candidate`
- Re-open the issue at `beginner`, `intermediate` or `advanced`

---

## The Big Picture

It's important for `Good First Issues` to feel welcoming and be ready-to-assign and succeed.

The Candidate label exists to help us:

- Make it easier to create `Good First Issues`
- Give maintainers time to improve the contribution experience
- Maintain a positive first-contribution experience
