We are proud to highlight all the contributors who have helped bring Hiero to life.
Whether through code, documentation, testing, or community support, these individuals have played a vital role in the development of Hiero.
Each contributor brings unique skills and ideas, helping us grow as a decentralized ecosystem.

If you want to contribute to Hiero, please check out our current [Hacktoberfest initiative](/hacktoberfest) that provides a lot of good first issues to get started with.
