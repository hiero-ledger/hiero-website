The **Hiero Python SDK** provides functionality to interact with the **Hedera Public DLT**(Distributed Ledger Technology), using the Python programming language.

Since its creation in late **September 2024**, and proposed to the **TSC** in late **November 2024**, the Python SDK has its origins as a **community project**. The Python SDK was **not** part of Hedera’s codebase that was donated to Hiero, a project in the **Linux Foundation Decentralized Trust (LFDT)**. Until then, Hedera did not have a supported SDK in pure Python.

Shortly after the first TSC call, several Hiero community members became interested, and have since made valuable contributions to the Python SDK functionality. Today, our Python SDK has **extensive functionality** which builds on initial work, including in **token services**, **file services**, and **smart contracts**. 

We have noticed a **recent strong uptick** in community interest over the last couple of weeks that is going to force us to think more about scaling and providing more opportunities to you!

## 🛠️ Development Highlights of the Week  

The SDK is now packing some powerful new features and fixes:

- **ContractCallQuery (#230)** – because smart contracts should feel smart.  
- **Custom Fee Support (#204)** – bringing flexible fee models.  
- **ECDSA Signature Format Fixes (#223)** – better supporting ECDSA key signing.  
- **ContractCreateTransaction (#197)** – the building block for creating Hedera smart contracts.  

We also saw **11 new Pull Requests** opened, ranging from deeper documentation to brand new queries and transactions — proving that the SDK is evolving on multiple fronts at once.

## ❤️ What Our Developer Community Loves  

Interest has surged in our Python SDK and with it, we are learning more about what excites new developers:

- **Well-documented tasks, complete with complementary guides**  
  → In response, we have expanded `Contributing.md` providing a **step-by-step** process to creating a successful pull request, issue creation, or blog post.  

- **Varied tasks**  
  → Our new developers love to challenge themselves progressively. Having a variety of issues helps them find within-reach opportunities and build from there.  

- **A space to chat and discuss**  
  → There are lots of questions at this early stage that are important to resolve to build confidence.  
  Having a warm space to hang out, such as our **Community Call** (Fortnightly on Wednesday, 2pm UTC [Join Here](https://zoom-lfx.platform.linuxfoundation.org/meetings/hiero?view=week)), active maintainers, and an existing **Discord server** ([Join Discord](https://discord.com/channels/905194001349627914/1336494517544681563)) is invaluable. We also have a new **Discussion Section** [Join The Conversation](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python/discussions) to expand on new ideas.

## 👥 Community Power in Action  

One of the most exciting developments is the **influx of new contributors**. We’ve seen fresh names not just opening PRs but delivering **high-quality, merge-ready features**. The energy is unmistakable.

**Special shout-outs go to:**
- Our passionate community developers!
- Nadine and Richard for planting the seed.  
- Contributors like Dosik13 who’ve delivered improvements in performance and scope.  
- First-time contributors this week who are already shaping the SDK’s future with meaningful updates.  
- The Hiero-LFDT team who’ve consistently supported the project.

## 💡 What’s Next?  

With the groundwork laid and the contributor base expanding, we’re now moving towards these **three key objectives** over the next few weeks:

1. A completed **token, file, and smart-contract service**.  
2. Grow channels to receive feedback from end-users.  
3. Scaling for the higher developer interest, such as:
   - More **good first issues** to onboard the next wave of contributors.  
   - **Polished docs** so developers can dive in without hesitation.  
   - **Ready-to-go examples** for quick adoption.  
   - Structures to **efficiently route work** and leverage the community.
