{{< show-date >}} We’re excited to share that elections are now open for end-user and community contributor seats on the [Hiero Technical Steering Committee (TSC)](https://www.lfdecentralizedtrust.org/blog/announcing-the-upcoming-elections-for-end-user-and-community-seats-on-the-hiero-technical-steering-committee-tsc). This is an important moment in Hiero’s evolution—bringing more diverse voices directly into the governance and technical direction of the project.
The TSC plays a crucial role in guiding Hiero’s roadmap, making key decisions about architecture, interoperability, and standards. These new seats are specifically designed to ensure the real-world needs of end users and community contributors are directly represented.

## 🗳️  Who Should Run for These Seats?
🧩 **End User Seat:** This position is designated for individuals or representatives from organizations that primarily utilize Hiero's software to build their products and services. If you or your organization are active consumers of Hiero's technology, your insights and experiences are invaluable to the TSC.


🛠️ **Contributor Seat:** This seat is intended for active contributors within the Hiero ecosystem, including developers, maintainers, and other participants who have demonstrated a commitment to the project's growth and success. If you have been actively involved in contributing code, documentation, or other resources to Hiero, we encourage you to consider this role.

## 👥 Why This Matters for End Users

If your organization relies on decentralized trust infrastructure—or plans to—**this is your opportunity to have a seat at the table**. Being part of the TSC means you’ll help shape how Hiero evolves to meet critical needs like interoperability, privacy, and accountability.
Whether you're a civic tech org, an NGO, a DAO, or an enterprise exploring verifiable credentials, your input is vital to ensuring Hiero remains relevant and usable across domains.


## 📌 Not Ready to Run? List Yourself as an Adopter!
Even if you’re not ready to run for a seat just yet, there’s still a meaningful way to contribute: **add your organization to the [adopters.md](https://github.com/hiero-identity/hiero/blob/main/adopters.md) file** in the Hiero GitHub repo.

This public list of adopters helps:
- Signal real-world demand for the protocol.
- Encourage ecosystem alignment.
- Make your voice more visible in ongoing technical discussions.

## 🚀 Let’s Build This Together

Hiero is a community-built protocol for a decentralized, verifiable trust layer. To make that vision work, we need **more than just builders**—we need the people and organizations who use the tools every day to **be seen, heard, and included**.
