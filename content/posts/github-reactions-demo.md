## 🚀 Testing GitHub Reactions Feature

This is a demo blog post to test our new GitHub reactions feature. This feature allows readers to react to blog posts through GitHub PR reactions, helping us measure community engagement.

### How It Works

The GitHub reactions feature:

1. **Displays reactions** from the corresponding GitHub PR
2. **Shows reaction counts** for different emoji types (👍, ❤️, 🚀, etc.)
3. **Provides a link** to the GitHub PR for users to add their own reactions
4. **Auto-discovers PRs** when no specific PR number is provided

### Testing the Feature

This demo post is linked to [PR #73](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-website/pull/73) which implements the GitHub reactions feature. You should see the reactions from that PR displayed below.

### Features Implemented

- ✅ GitHub API integration
- ✅ Reaction caching and rate limiting
- ✅ Auto-discovery of related PRs
- ✅ Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- ✅ Development mode with mock data
- ✅ Error handling and fallbacks
- ✅ Accessibility features

### Try It Out

Visit the [GitHub PR #73](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-website/pull/73) to add your own reactions, and they should appear on this blog post!
