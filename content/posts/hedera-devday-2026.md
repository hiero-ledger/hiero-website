## 🚀 An Exciting Day for Roadmap, Innovation & Technical Conversations

On February 17th, builders, maintainers and ecosystem collaborators gathered in Denver for Hedera's DevDay event. This was an exciting day for the Hedera community guided by exciting deep dive presentations into what’s next for the Hedera projects and the broader open-source community around it.

Hosted as part of the Hedera community’s ongoing commitment to transparency and developer engagement, [Hedera DevDay 2026](https://devday.hedera.com/home) delivered roadmap updates, technical insights, hands-on demos, and exciting opportunities to collaborate across projects.

The [event's agenda](https://devday.hedera.com/agenda) featured several workshops including:

- Deploying Smart Contracts That Run Themselves
- Designing for Scale: Batch 1,000 Records On-Chain Using Merkle Proofs
- Cross-Chain Development on Hedera with LayerZero
- Confidential by Design: Zero-Knowledge Proofs and Privacy-Preserving Execution on L1

As well as several presentations on 

- Unlocking the Future of EVM: The Hedera EVM, Ethereum Compatibility with Hashgraph Superpowers
- Hedera's Major 2026 Network Upgrade: Block Streams, Block Nodes, and TSS
- Inside Hashgraph Cryptography: A Fireside Chat with Dr. Leemon Baird

And one of the highlight presentations of the day **What's New in Hedera 2026** In which several initiatives were introduced for the first time in a formal overview.

## 🚀 The “Hello Hiero” Booth And Its Standout Success

One of the most energizing parts of the day was the interactions at the **Hello Hiero** booth station.

Hiero maintainers and LFDT representatives had the opportunity to connect with ecosystem collaborators and discuss active project development as well as roadmap plans. The team was also able to share the story on how the Hiero project became part of the opensource community under the [LF Decentralized Trust](https://www.lfdecentralizedtrust.org/projects/hiero) umbrella and discuss current milestones. 

The team also welcomed new contributors to participate in the work that is happening around the Good First Issues initiative in our SDKs as well as discover the work in progress for the featured moonshot initiatives. 

The booth helped strengthen awareness that Hiero is the open, vendor-neutral home for Hedera’s evolving technical standards and reference implementations.

## 📣 What's New In The Roadmap In Hiero

Richard Bair delivered an exciting roadmap preview, outlining several bold “moonshot” initiatives that are actively being developed in the open under LF Decentralized Trust within the [hiero-ledger](https://github.com/hiero-ledger) GitHub organization.

These initiatives represent a great transformation in the future of the project:

🌕 Project Bonneville

A moonshot program to build a gigagas EVM with a just-in-time compiler enabling native performance of EVM programs. This initiative aims to dramatically increase execution performance while maintaining compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem.

⚡ Project Lightspeed

A moonshot program to reduce consensus latency to theoretical minimums limited only by the speed of light between nodes. This is an attempt to push distributed consensus into physical layer's efficiency territory.

🔥 Project Full-Send

A moonshot program to remove artificial throttles entirely, enabling full throughput on the network. The system would dynamically adapt to real-time network and node performance based on measurable infrastructure conditions.

🌉 Project CLPR

An ABFT Cross Ledger Protocol with: No bridge nodes, No liquidity pools and 100% decentralization. CLPR envisions seamless cross-ledger interoperability without the typical architectural compromises.

The Hiero community can already be part of this exciting work by contributing to the [hiero-ledger](https://github.com/hiero-ledger) related Issues and work branches in the [Jessica TODO: Add issues and branch references]
