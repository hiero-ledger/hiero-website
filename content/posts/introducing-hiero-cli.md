## 📣 Join the Next Chapter of the CLI! Explore Hiero CLI

We’re thrilled to share a major milestone: the Hedera CLI is transitioned into Hiero CLI and is part of [hiero-ledger](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-cli)!. 
This shift reflects not just a rebranding, but a deeper philosophical transition toward openness, extensibility, and community-driven development.

Read the full announcement in the LFDT blog site here: [“Transitioning Hedera CLI to Hiero CLI: Embracing Open Source and Extensibility”](https://www.lfdecentralizedtrust.org/blog/transitioning-hedera-cli-to-hiero-cli-embracing-open-source-and-extensibility?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## Summary of events

- **Project rehoming & governance shift** - The CLI is moving from its original Hedera home into Hiero (in hiero-ledger) as part of LFDT’s open governance model.
  This unifies the tool with Hiero’s broader mission of neutral, collaborative infrastructure. 

- **Evolution of architecture** - The biggest technical change is the introduction of a plugin-based architecture.
  Instead of a monolithic CLI, there will be a stable core and plugin contracts so that anyone can extend or customize functionality via community-built modules.

- **Developer experience & use cases** - The original Hedera CLI grew from internal scripts to a full-featured tool that supports automation, developer onboarding, and CI/CD workflows. 

- **Community empowerment and future opportunities** - Developers, integrators, and domain experts will be able to contribute plugins, tooling, and enhancements, all while preserving a stable, secure core.
