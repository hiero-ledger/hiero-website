Open-source contributions are the lifeblood of any vibrant software ecosystem, and Hiero recognizes this. That's why the Hiero SDK Collaboration Hub was created—a centralized platform designed to enhance collaboration, streamline contributions, and provide transparent guidance for developers and maintainers involved with Hiero SDKs.

## What is the Hiero SDK Collaboration Hub?

The Hiero SDK Collaboration Hub isn't another SDK repository or a place for implementation-specific issues. Rather, it acts as a dedicated resource center to simplify and standardize the contribution process across all Hiero SDKs.

Key purposes include:
- Facilitating open discussions through structured proposals.
- Sharing best practices and onboarding resources for new contributors.
- Providing reusable templates for proposals, issues, and pull requests.
- Documenting technical decisions via meeting notes.

## Structure of the Repository

The repository is thoughtfully organized into the following key directories:
- **[Proposals](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/sdk-collaboration-hub/tree/main/proposals) (`proposals/`):** Home to already-discussed and approved design proposals.
- **[Guides](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/sdk-collaboration-hub/tree/main/guides) (`guides/`):** Essential reading for newcomers and seasoned contributors alike, covering everything from best practices to detailed contribution workflows.
- **[Templates](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/sdk-collaboration-hub/tree/main/templates) (`templates/`):** Streamline your submissions and communications with standardized templates for consistency and clarity.
- **[Meeting Notes](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/sdk-collaboration-hub/tree/main/meetings) (`meetings/`):** Keep informed and up-to-date with summaries of past technical discussions and decisions.
- **[Discussions](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/sdk-collaboration-hub/discussions) (in GitHub Discussions):** Participate in discussions around design proposals, enabling collaboration around new features or improvements.

## Who is it for?

This hub caters to:
- **New Contributors:** A perfect starting point, offering clear guidelines and onboarding documentation to simplify your entry into the Hiero SDK community.
- **Experienced Developers:** Ideal for those who want to dive deeper into technical discussions, propose enhancements, or align with ongoing development efforts.
- **Project Maintainers:** A valuable tool for coordinating contributions, managing community input, and ensuring transparency in decision-making processes.
