## 🎯 What Is Office Hour?

An Office Hour (fortnightly Wednesdays 5pm UTC) is your dedicated time to get real‑time help on:

- Understanding proposed features
- Creating your first pull request
- Walking through unfamiliar parts of the codebase  
- Troubleshooting test failures  

This is your time to ask questions and learn from a mentor!
> **Note:** Office Hour Sessions are **not recorded**.

This differs from our [Python SDK Community Call](https://zoom-lfx.platform.linuxfoundation.org/meetings/hiero?view=week) (fortnightly Wednesdays 2pm UTC)  .

At the community call we:
- Share news
- Share progress
- Learn about community issues

The community call is recorded and later shared to Youtube.
