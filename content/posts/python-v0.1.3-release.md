## 🚀 Latest Release: v0.1.3 (July 7, 2025)

In this release, we packed dozens of new transaction classes, queries, and utility improvements:

- **Various new classes**, including:
  - `Duration`
  - `AccountInfoQuery`
- **Extensive token services**, such as:
  - `NFTTokenCreateTransaction` for spinning up non‑fungible tokens
  - `TokenUnfreezeTransaction` to unfreeze tokens when needed
  - `TokenWipeTransaction` for wiping balances clean
  - `TokenNFTInfoQuery` to fetch NFT metadata
  - `TokenRejectTransaction` to manage association rejections
  - `TokenUpdateNftsTransaction` for batch NFT updates
- **Abstractions & node implementation**  
  – Introduced an `executable` abstraction and `node` implementation to simplify the codebase and make it easier to scale  
- **Improved testing & logging**  
  – Individual `unit` and `integration` tests for each transaction type  
  – Extensions to the `logging` module  
- **Pythonic type hinting**  
  – Added `type` annotations across several modules, with documentation on setting up [Mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io)

## 🔭 Smart Contracts on the Horizon

We’ve laid the groundwork in our token and file‑service layers—now we’re shifting gears into file service and smart contract logic, with upcoming support for:

- `ContractCreateTransaction`
- `ContractExecuteTransaction`
- …and beyond.

Get ready to deploy and interact with contracts entirely in Python!
