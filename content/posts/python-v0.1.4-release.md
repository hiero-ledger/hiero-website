# 🚀 The Python SDK Has a New Release – Welcome v0.1.4

This extensive update represents a **big leap** forward, especially for smart contract functionality, and comes with a range of improvements that make building on Hedera with Python easier, clearer, and more powerful. A huge thank you to our **talented contributors** for making this release possible.

---

## ✨ What’s New in 0.1.4

Using the Hiero Python SDK, you can now interact with the Hedera network in more ways than ever before.

#### 🚀 Work with Smart Contracts
- Create and Update contracts with `ContractCreateTransaction` and `ContractUpdateTransaction`
- Call and execute contract functions using `ContractCallQuery` and `ContractExecuteTransaction`.
- Inspect deployed contracts with `ContractInfoQuery` and `ContractBytecodeQuery`.
- Upload both `.bin` and `.bin-runtime` bytecode formats with improved utilities.

#### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Manage Accounts and Tokens
- Update account properties with `AccountUpdateTransaction`.
- Cancel pending airdrops via `TokenCancelAirdropTransaction`.
- Work with new airdrop classes: `PendingAirdropId`, `PendingAirdropRecord`.

#### 📂 Handle Files on the Network
- Update, delete, and query files with `FileUpdateTransaction`, `FileDeleteTransaction`, `FileContentsQuery`, and `FileInfoQuery`.
- Append file contents using `FileAppendTransaction`.

#### 🔐 Improved Key Support
- Added legacy ECDSA DER parse support.
- Clearer documentation for `PrivateKey.from_string`.
- Fixes for missing ECDSA handling in certain transaction types.

#### 📝 PEP8 Style & Code Quality
- Migrated many naming conventions from **camelCase → snake_case** to align with PEP8 (old names will still work for now, but will be removed in the next release).
- Linting and formatting improvements in the consensus module.

## 📚 Improved Developer Experience
With the surge of developer interest in the SDK, we’ve also invested in documentation:
- **Extended Contributing Guide**: step-by-step instructions for contributing, writing blog posts, and getting support.
- **Upstream Sync Guide**: documentation on how to sync with `main`.
