# 🚀 Hiero Python SDK – Announcing Release v0.1.6

We’re thrilled to announce **version 0.1.6** of the Hiero Python SDK!  
This release introduces powerful new transaction capabilities, improved allowance management, and refinements across multiple SDK examples — making development on Hedera even smoother for Python users.

A huge thank you to our talented contributors for making this release possible. ❤️

---

## ✨ What’s New in 0.1.6

This release expands the SDK’s transaction and topic management features, giving developers more flexibility and precision when interacting with Hedera.

### 🧾 New Features
- **Revenue-Generating Topic Examples:** Explore new topic tests and examples to better understand revenue-based use cases.
- **Enhanced Topic APIs:** Added `TopicCreate`, `TopicUpdate`, and `TopicInfo` transactions with new parameters:
  - `fee_schedule_key`
  - `fee_exempt_keys`
  - `custom_fees`
- **New Classes and Transactions:**
  - `CustomFeeLimit`
  - `TokenNftAllowance`
  - `TokenAllowance`
  - `HbarAllowance`
  - `HbarTransfer`
  - `AccountAllowanceApproveTransaction`
  - `AccountAllowanceDeleteTransaction`
- **Approved Transfer Support:** `TransferTransaction` now supports approved transfers.
- **New API Utility:** Added `Transaction.set_transaction_id()` for finer transaction control.
- **Allowance Examples:** Check out new practical examples:
  - `hbar_allowance.py`
  - `token_allowance.py`
  - `nft_allowance.py`

---

## 🔄 Improvements & Changes
We’ve streamlined the SDK’s internal handling and improved code readability across key modules.

- `TransferTransaction` now uses `TokenTransfer` and `HbarTransfer` classes instead of dicts, offering a cleaner and more structured approach.
- Added **checksum validation** for `TokenId` for safer and more reliable operations.
- Refactored examples for better readability and consistency:
  - `token_cancel_airdrop.py`
  - `token_associate.py` (now includes association verification query — PR [#367](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python/pull/367))
  - `account_create.py` (enhanced modularity and readability — PR [#363](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python/pull/363))

---

## 🐞 Fixes
- Fixed a **type assignment issue** in `token_transfer_list.py`.
- Corrected internal method references (`__require_not_frozen()` → `_require_not_frozen()`).
- Removed redundant `_is_frozen` method to reduce internal complexity.

---

## 📌 What else changed (high-level highlights)

This release bundles a number of additional PRs and fixes that improved examples, docs, type hints, and test coverage. Notable items in the release include:
