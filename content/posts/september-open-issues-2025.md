The community team at the Hiero Python SDK has been working behind the scenes since November 2024 to help Python developers plug into Hedera’s decentralized network using Python code.

We're calling all Python developers—from seasoned veterans to enthusiastic beginners—to join us in this effort. Helping us solve these issues is a fantastic way to gain practical experience and strengthen our collective codebase.

Here’s how you can roll up your sleeves, gain Python skills, and help our SDK blossom:
