The community team at the Hiero Python SDK has been working behind the scenes since November 2024 to help Python developers plug into Hedera’s decentralized network using Python code.

If you’re interested in helping us grow our SDK codebase and documentation this August—whether you’re a smart‑contract wizard or just dipping your toes into technical contributions—we’re striving to create a welcoming space for you. 

Here’s how you can roll up your sleeves, gain Python skills, and help our SDK blossom:

## 🚀 What’s Going On?

We’ve built strong functionality around consensus, queries, transactions, and tokens. Our file‑service features are advancing fast—and now we’re pushing deeper into **Smart Contract support**.

Several open issues are actively being addressed, while others are ready for new contributors.  

- **Experienced developers**:  
  - [#343 – Test across multiple python versions](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python/issues/343))
  - [#46 – Improve Token Checksum Handling](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python/issues/46)

- **New developers**:  
  We’ve labeled many "Good First Issues" ideal for early contributions. For example, you could help with:
  - [#71 – Add/improve a developer quickstart guide](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python/issues/71)
  - [#178 – Default Signing Documentation](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python/issues/178)
