## ðŸ“£ The results for the Hiero Technical Steering Committee elections are here!

We are pleased to announce the results of the recent elections for the Hiero Technical Steering Committee (TSC) End User and Contributor seats.

Congratulations to [**Michael Kantor**](https://github.com/kantorcodes), who has been elected to the Contributor seat, and to [**Milan Wiercx Van Rhijn**](https://github.com/MilanWR), who has been elected to the End User seat on the Hiero Technical Steering Committee.

We look forward to formally recognizing their appointments at the upcoming Hiero TSC meeting scheduled for **June 3rd**. For details on this and other Hiero project events, please refer to the [Hiero public calendar](https://zoom-lfx.platform.linuxfoundation.org/meetings/hiero?view=week).
