# Joining the Hiero Community on Discord

Welcome! Our primary space for real-time questions, collaboration, and community chat is the Hiero Discord channel, located within the Linux Foundation Decentralized Trust (LFDT) server.

## What is Discord?

Discord is a popular, free communication platform used by many communities, including open-source projects.

## How to Join and Find the Hiero Channel

Follow these essential steps:

1.  **Join the Linux Foundation Decentralized Trust (LFDT) Server:**
    * Click the official invite link: **[LFDT Discord](https://discord.gg/hyperledger)**
    * If you're new to Discord, create a free account when prompted.
    * Follow Discord's instructions to enter the server.

2.  **Agree to Server Rules:**
    * Upon joining, you will likely land in a `#welcome` or `#rules` channel.
    * Read the server rules carefully. You **must agree** to these rules (usually via a button or emoji reaction ✅ at the bottom) to gain full access to the server channels.
    * Once you agree, other channels should become visible.

3.  **Access the Hiero Channel:**
    The Linux Foundation Decentralized Trust server comprises chats for each LFDT project.

    In the set up, you'll be asked to confirm which project chats you are interested in.
    * Be sure to select Hiero, and add it to your favourites.

    * **Direct Link (Recommended):** After agreeing to the rules and setting up the Hiero server, click and save these links to go directly to a channel of interest:
