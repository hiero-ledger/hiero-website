# Joining the Hiero Community on Discord

Welcome! Our primary space for real-time questions, collaboration, and community chat is the Hiero Discord channel, located within the Linux Foundation Decentralized Trust (LFDT) server.

## What is Discord?

Discord is a popular, free communication platform used by many communities, including open-source projects.

## How to Join and Find the Hiero Channel

    * If you're new to Discord, create a free account when prompted.
    * Follow Discord's instructions to enter the server.

2.  **Agree to Server Rules:**
    * Upon joining, you will likely land in a `#welcome` or `#rules` channel.

    * Be sure to select Hiero, and add it to your favourites.
